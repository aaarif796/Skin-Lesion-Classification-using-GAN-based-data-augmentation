# Skin-Lesion-Classification-using-GAN-based-data-augmentation
Skin lesion classification remains a significant challenge due to class imbalances and the need for high diagnostic accuracy. This project implements an integrated deep learning framework combining data augmentation, feature extraction, and hybrid classification techniques to enhance classification performance.
